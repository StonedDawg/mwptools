`replay_bbox_ltm.rb` is a ruby scrip to transpose Blackbox / INAV flight
data recordings into LTM (LightTelemetry) messages over UDP or serial
(Bluetooth) devices.

== Introduction

Blackbox is an invaluable tool for development and flight analysis for
Cleanflight and its derivatives such as INAV. This program
(`replay_bbox_ltm.rb`) provides a means to replay a Blackbox recording in a
geospatial context using one of the well know ground stations
https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools[mwp] (Linux) and http://ez-gui.com/[ezgui]
(Android). The LTM (LightTelemetry) protocol is used to replay the
Blackbox log data into the ground station; thus any ground station or
OSD that supports LTM can be used for flight visualisation.

Note that `replay_bbox_ltm.rb` is integrated with https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools[mwp] and replay is available as a menu option. It is not necessary to read this document beyond Dependencies to use `replay_bbox_ltm.rb` with https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools[mwp].

== Platforms

`replay_bbox_ltm.rb` is intended to run on most popular platforms (Linux,
OSX, Windows). It is developed on Arch Linux and tested on Arch,
Fedora, Ubuntu and occasionally, Windows 10.

== Dependencies

There are a number of dependencies that must be satisfied to run the
`replay_bbox_ltm.rb` script:

* A Ruby Interpreter;
* The Ruby 'rubyserial' gem, and for Windows, the win32api gem;
* The Blackbox utility 'blackbox_decode'.

The installation of these dependencies is described below.

=== Dependency Installation

Ruby:: Version 2.0 or greater is required.
* Linux: Install via your distribution package manager.
* OSX: you can use third-party tools (rbenv and RVM).
* Windows: Install the latest version from
http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/[rubyinstaller.org] (aka MRI). Alternately,
the https://www.cygwin.com/[cygwin] version may be used, however this
requires cygwin gcc is also installed to build ffi (a rubyserial
dependency otherwise satisfied by the MRI install). For MRI, set the
options to associate `.rb` extensions with ruby.

NOTE: On Windows, run the environment specific interpreter; running
the MRI (rubyinstaller) interpreter under cygwin may not work as
expected. Using the cygwin ruby is unlikely to work for a serial
device.

NOTE: On Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, you must specfically install Ruby 2.0, the
default is 1.9.
----
sudo apt install ruby2.0
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/ruby ruby /usr/bin/ruby2.0 10
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gem gem /usr/bin/gem2.0 10
----
NOTE: rubyserial depends on ffi. If your package manager does not
offer this (it is part of the Windows install, but not default
elsewhere), then you may need to install that as well, either as an
explicit OS package, or via the `gem` command. rubyserial is an
optional dependency.

For further details, please refer to
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/.

Ruby Serial Gem:: This is optional and is only necessary to replay
blackbox files over bluetooth (e.g. it visualise in EzGui); it is not
necessary to replay within https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools[mwp].
Once you have ruby installed, in a console (CLI)
window:
----
$ gem install rubyserial
$ gem install win32api # Windows, excluding cygwin
----
Blackbox Utilities:: Blackbox is hosted at
https://github.com/iNavFlight/blackbox-tools/[github]. Instructions
are included for all major operating systems. Binary releases for
Windows and OSX are available from
https://github.com/iNavFlight/blackbox-tools/releases[the releases
page].

`blackbox_decode` must be on the user's PATH when the `replay_bbox_ltm.rb`
script is invoked.

== Installation

Installation is as simple as copying the `replay_bbox_ltm.rb` script
somewhere convenient. The https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools[mwp] installer will install it for you, by default.

== Communication with the GS

`replay_bbox_ltm.rb` can communicate with the ground station using a UDP
socket or a serial device, typically a Bluetooth device for
communications. At the time of publication, UDP is only supported
by https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools[mwp].

=== Setting up serial communications

The easiest way to set up serial comms is to use a USB-TTY adaptor on
the desktop computer running `replay_bbox_ltm.rb`, with a cross-over
connection to a Bluetooth TTY device, which can then communicate with
EZGUI (or https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools[mwp], though UDP is easier in this case).

The image below (from the

wiki]) shows the connection.

Usage for ezgui and https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools[mwp] is decribed later.

Note that it is __possible__ to use just the computer's Bluetooth
device (without a hardware adapter); setting this up is somewhat OS
dependent and beyond the scope of this document. On Linux, one would
use the `sdptool add channel=N SP` and  `rfcomm listen` commands.

== Usage

It is *_essential_* that `blackbox_decode` is on the PATH, so either
install it on the extant PATH or extend the PATH to cover the
directory  containing `blackbox_decode`.

=== Verify the installation

You can verify the install by running ruby in 'check' mode:
----
$ ruby -cw ./replay_bbox_ltm.rb
Syntax OK
----
You should see the 'Syntax OK' message.

Next, verify that the application runs:
----
$ ./replay_bbox_ltm.rb --help
replay_bbox_ltm.rb [options] file
Replay bbox log as LTM
    -u, --udp=ADDR                   udp target (localhost:3000)
    -s, --serial-device=DEV
    -i, --index=IDX
    -t, --vehicle-type=TYPE
    -d, --declination=DEC            Mag Declination (default -1.3)
    -g, --force-gps-heading          Use GPS course instead of compass
    -4, --force-ipv4
    -?, --help                       Show this message
----
The [options] are:

--udp, -u:: When using UDP as the transport for LTM messages, this defines
  the UDP host and port. If a host name is given, it is assumed that
  the specified host has bound to the defined socket. If the host
  name is blank, then `replay_bbox_ltm.rb` will bind to the socket. The UDP
  address is defined as:
+
----
  udp://host:port
----

+
The udp:// part may be omitted, so valid examples are:
+
----
  -u udp://:4321
  --udp :4321
  --udp udp://somehost:4321
  -u somehost:4321
----

+
The first two examples are equivalent, and the last two are
equivalent. By default, `replay_bbox_ltm.rb` prefers IPv6 where
available. You can force IPv4 with the `--force-ipv4` option.

--serial-device, -s:: Defines the serial device, where this is used as
  the LTM transport. For example:

+
----
  -s /dev/ttyUSB0
  --serial-device /dev/rfcomm1
  -s COM6
----

+
The default baud rate is 115200, this may be changed by appending
@rate to the serial definition:
+
----
  -s /dev/rfcomm2@57600
  -s COM7@38400
----

+
NOTE:: Only one of UDP and serial definitions should be given.

--index, -i:: Defines the index of the recording in the the blackbox
file. If this is not given, the first recording (index 1) is used.

--declination, -d:: The magnetic declination in decimal degrees. If not
  given, a value appropriate to the New Forest area of southern
  England is used.
+
You can preset the declination as decimal degrees in a JSON file
`$HOME/.config/mwp/replay_ltm.json`, as (for the New Forest):
----
{"declination":-1}
----

--vehicle-type, -t:: The vehicle type defines the vehicle icon shown
  in mwp or ezgui. Standard MultiWii values are used (mwp interpretation).
+
[start = 0]
. Undefined (an arrow in mwp, useful for checking the compass)
. Tricopter
. Quad+
. QuadX
. Bicopter
. QuadX
. Y6
. Hex6+
. Flying_Wing
. Y4
. Hex6X
. OctoX8
. OctoFlat+
. OctoFlatX
. Aeroplane
. Heli
. Heli
. V-Tail4
. Hex6+

----force-gps-heading, -g:: Uses the GPS ground course for vehicle
    orientation (instead of compass). For vehicles without a compass
    (e.g. fixed wing).

--force-ipv4, -4:: Forces IPv4 (for dual stack systems without full
  IPv6 resolvers).

`replay_bbox_ltm.rb` expects the ground station to poll it (this is normal
https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools[mwp] and ezgui behaviour; both these applications will poll using
MultiWii / Cleanflight identification messages when first
invoked).

Typically, when using the ground station with a flight controller, one
first powers up the FC, thus enabling its communications port then
connects from the ground station: `replay_bbox_ltm.rb` emulates this
behaviour. `replay_bbox_ltm.rb` provides basic INAV identification messages
to the ground station before broadcasting the blackbox file as LTM
messages.

It is also possible to bypass the polling expectation for serial
devices and when invoked as a UDP listener. In these circumstances,
on startup, `replay_bbox_ltm.rb` displays the message:
----
Waiting for GS to start (RETURN to continue) :
----

If you press return before any poll from the ground station,
`replay_bbox_ltm.rb` will continue; this may be acceptable for serial
connections, however it will cause the application to exit for UDP, as
it does not know the address of the client system. This is intended to
support any client such as an OSD that does not initially poll.

=== Example Command lines

----
# replay bbox log, index 2, flying wing, UDP listener
./replay_bbox_ltm.rb -i 2 -t 8 -u :3000 LOG0042.TXT
# replay bbox log, index 1 (default), quadX (default), USB (for ezgui/BT)
./replay_bbox_ltm.rb -s /dev/ttyUSB0 LOG0042.TXT
