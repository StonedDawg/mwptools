# mwp on Cygwin

From 2015-12-30, it is possible to build and run pretty much all of the mwptools suite in [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/). It is the best performing Windows option.

* Runs from a desktop short cut
* Audio works
* Easy device names translation

## Installation

See the [wiki](https://github.com/stronnag/mwptools/wiki/mwp-on-cygwin)

No support is offered for running under cygwin.
