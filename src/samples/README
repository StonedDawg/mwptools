As Ubuntu appears quite popular and some users may not know how to install
ruby and any dependencies:

On Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev

$ sudo apt-get install ruby-nokogiri ruby-yajl
$ sudo gem install ruby_kml

Log to SQL

Convenient way to analyse log files

select max(range) from readings where ... etc

Depends on the sequel library. The default database manager is sqlite3
and the database file is f.sqlite in the current driectory. You can
use any RDBMS supported by sequel (postgresql, mysql etc).

On Ubuntu:

# at a minimum
$ sudo apt-get install ruby-sqlite3 sqlite3 ruby-sequel
