Experimental script to parse data from Frsky SPort telemetry.

I do not have a Trannis / Frsky TX; the data was provided by another
(see <https://github.com/opentx/opentx/wiki/Taranis-serial-port> for
details of TX connections).

In future source data and black box log will hopefully become
available, for the moment there is the script and a test log (captured
data).

E&OE. The detail encapsulated in the script has been compiled from
various internet sources; no thanks to the unhelpful, anti-free
software, proprietary attitude from Frsky.

Consider this BSD licenced.
